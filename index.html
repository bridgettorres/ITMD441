  <p>In this course students examine core web technologies that are integral in the
    creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover fundamental web
    protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus will be placed on writing
    modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with HTML and CSS to enable rich user
    interfaces and communication with other services. Current frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be

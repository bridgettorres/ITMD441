  <h2>ITMD 441 Web Application Foundations</h2>
  <p>In this course students examine core web technologies that are integral in the
    creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover fundamental web
    protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus will be placed on writing
    modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with HTML and CSS to enable rich user
    interfaces and communication with other services. Current frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be
    explored</p>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p> Hello! My name is Bridget Torres ! <br>
      My web experience started in high school when I took a web development class in which we were tasked to create web pages such as a website with our favorite recipes.<br>
      As of right now, I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Science at IIT. Among my passions, I am particularly interested in everything that has to do with technology and design. Overall I enjoy using new technologies as well as expanding my range of expertise in new frameworks.
